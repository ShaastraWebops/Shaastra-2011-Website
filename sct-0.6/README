Sphene Community Tools are django applications designed to be easily
pluggable into any django project. A ready to be used example website
is also provided (communitydraft).

# Feedback

I would appreciate any kind of feedback (if you encountered any problems,
feature requests, etc.) either in the forums at http://sct.sphene.net or 
directly by email: herbert.poul@gmail.com

# Getting started

The easiest way to get SCT up and running is to use the communitydraft
application as a starting point. This method should give you a working
website in minutes.

For more details see communitydraft/README
