CommunityDraft is an example website which uses the SCT applications. 
It is basically not just a draft but a full blown website which is used to 
provide http://sct.sphene.net (I'm currently only using a couple of different 
settings and 2 overloaded templates to add google analytics and the bookmark 
link below the navigation)

# Download

To get the CommunityDraft up and running is very easy actually. After you've 
got python and django installed simply checkout 'communitytools' and 
'communitydraft' from subversion (see [Downloads]) into the same directory 
(or download a release).

## Requirements

Make sure you have installed all requirements for SCT - You can find them in communitytools/README or on the [Documentation] page.

# Configuration

Now change into the directory communitydraft/community/ and copy the file settings_local.py.tmpl to settings_local.py and configure the database settings:

    DATABASE_ENGINE = 'postgresql'   # 'postgresql', 'mysql', 'sqlite3' or 
                                     # 'ado_mssql'.
    DATABASE_NAME = 'communitydraft' # Or path to database file if using sqlite3.
    DATABASE_USER = 'django'         # Not used with sqlite3.
    DATABASE_PASSWORD = 'test'       # Not used with sqlite3.
    DATABASE_HOST = '127.0.0.1'      # Set to empty string for localhost. Not 
                                     # used with sqlite3.
    DATABASE_PORT = ''               # Set to empty string for default. Not 
                                     # used with sqlite3.

# Setup

After you completed this configuration (and configured your database accordingly) 
you can create the database tables by running:

    ./manage.py syncdb


from the same directory. In the end you will be asked to create a superuser 
account  - you should do this.

# Running

And as a last step.. start the project:

    ./manage.py runserver

By default this will start the server running on port 8000 so access your new 
cool website at: http://127.0.0.1:8000

# What Now ?

After you've successfully set up your website locally you may wonder how to

- Use it
    - See the [Documentation](http://sct.sphene.net/wiki/show/Documentation/)
- Deploy it
    - Please see the django documentation: <http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/>
        - mod_python: <http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/modpython/>
        - FastCGI, SCGI or AJP: <http://www.djangoproject.com/documentation/fastcgi/>
- Customize your website
    - The simplest way to customize your website is probably by overloading a couple of templates. This can be done by modifying the settings variable TEMPLATE_DIRS and adding your own directory to the beginning. - You might need to see the django documentation on how the templating system works.
