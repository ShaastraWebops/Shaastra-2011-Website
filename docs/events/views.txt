This is the documentation for the events app- views documentation.
---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
1. coordslogin : Login view, authenticates user, goes to dashboard. -> Change it to login view, where anyone and everyone can login, add other properties to the session variables over here, may come in handy later
2. logout -  Normal logout view
3. remove_quick_tab : Delete tab object, forgot to remove the corresponding files before delete.
4. add_quick_tab : Instead of passing the tab id, and making a query there, the object can directly passed as an argument, and directly save view can be called in the fileuploadhandler.
5. dashboard : passes event, tabs to tempalte
6. fileuploadhandler : Takes file, event, tab and save tab and file object
7. show_quick_tab : Gets event, and if coords shows edit, any reason why POST method is required ?
8.
